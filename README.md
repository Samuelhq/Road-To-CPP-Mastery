## 📖 About This Journey

This repository documents my complete learning journey from zero programming knowledge to embedded systems proficiency. The roadmap is designed for:
- **Daily incremental learning** with consistent GitHub commits
- **Hands-on practice** with real hardware (Arduino)
- **Portfolio building** for career development
- **Mastery of C++** fundamentals and embedded systems concepts

**Timeline:** 9 months (January 2026 - September 2026)  
**Commitment:** 1-2 hours daily  
**Goal:** Build professional-level embedded systems projects

---

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

By the end of this journey, I will be able to:
- ✅ Write clean, efficient C++ code following industry standards
- ✅ Understand memory management, pointers, and low-level programming
- ✅ Design object-oriented systems for embedded applications
- ✅ Interface with hardware using multiple communication protocols (UART, I2C, SPI)
- ✅ Develop Arduino-based projects with sensors and actuators
- ✅ Implement state machines and real-time systems concepts
- ✅ Debug and optimize code for resource-constrained environments
- ✅ Create professional documentation and maintain version control

## 📜 Learning Principles

Throughout this journey, I'm committed to:

1. **Consistency over intensity** - Daily small progress beats weekend cramming
2. **Understanding over memorization** - Focus on "why" not just "how"
3. **Practice over theory** - Type every example, don't just read
4. **Quality over speed** - It's okay to take longer on difficult concepts
5. **Document as I learn** - Future me will thank present me
6. **Ask for help** when stuck for 30+ minutes
7. **Celebrate small wins** - Every completed exercise matters
